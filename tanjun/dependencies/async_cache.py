"""Interface for an optional asynchronous gateway cache dependency.

This allows you to share data between instances using something like a redis cache
(for example) and will be used by standard Tanjun components as well as
extensions if implemented.

.. note::
    While there aren't any standard implementations for these interfaces, a
    Redis implementation of this for the types found in Hikari's gateway cache
    can be found in [hikari-sake](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Sake)
    \\>=v1.0.1a1 (exposed by `RedisResource.add_to_tanjun`).

Tanjun will use the following type dependencies for these interfaces if they are
registered with the client:

* `AsyncCache[str, hikari.InviteWithMetadata]`
* `SfCache[hikari.GuildChannel]`
* `SfCache[hikari.KnownCustomEmoji]`
* `SfCache[hikari.Guild]`
* `SfCache[hikari.Role]`
* `SfCache[hikari.User]`
* `SfGuildBound[hikari.Member]`
* `SfGuildBound[hikari.MemberPresence]`
* `SfGuildBound[hikari.VoiceState]`
* `SfGuildBound[hikari.Role]`
* `SingleStoreCache[hikari.OwnUser]`
* `SingleStoreCache[hikari.Application]`
* `SingleStoreCache[hikari.AuthorizationApplication]`
