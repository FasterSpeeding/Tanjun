        components
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include

        embed
            An embed to respond with.
        embeds
            A sequence of embeds to respond with.
        mentions_everyone
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all mentions will be parsed.

        ctx

        ValueError
            If `delete_after` would be more than 14 minutes after the slash
            command was called.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; too many components.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel or the
            person you are trying to message has the DM's disabled.
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the channel is not found.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.
