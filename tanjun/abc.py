        delete_after : typing.Union[datetime.timedelta, float, int, None]

            .. note::
                As of writing, this does not support ephemeral slash command responses.
        attachment : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.Resourceish]
            A singular attachment to edit the initial response with.
        attachments : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Resourceish]]
            A sequence of attachments to edit the initial response with.
        component : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.Embed]
            An embed to replace the initial response with.
        embeds : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Embed]]
            A sequence of embeds to replace the initial response with.
        replace_attachments : bool
            Whether to replace the attachments of the response or not. Default to `False`.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.UndefinedOr[bool]

            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or `hikari.PartialUser`
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        Notes
        -----
        Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
        convenience.
        * If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
            resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
            sending the message. Subclasses of
            `hikari.WebResource` such as
            `hikari.URL`,
            `hikari.Attachment`,
            `hikari.Emoji`,
            `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
            This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
            resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
            scalability.
        * If a `hikari.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
            that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
            with a randomized file name if not provided.
        * If a `hikari.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
            `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
            on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
            as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
            using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
            type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
            the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
            behaviour).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.Message
            The message that has been edited.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
        TypeError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are specified.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;

            .. note::
                As of writing, this does not support ephemeral slash command responses.
        attachment : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.Resourceish]
            A singular attachment to edit the last response with.
        attachments : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Resourceish]]
            A sequence of attachments to edit the last response with.
        component : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.Embed]
            An embed to replace the last response with.
        embeds : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Embed]]
            A sequence of embeds to replace the last response with.
        replace_attachments : bool
            Whether to replace the attachments of the response or not. Default to `False`.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.UndefinedOr[bool]

            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or `hikari.PartialUser`
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        Notes
        -----
        Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
        convenience.
        * If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
            resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
            sending the message. Subclasses of
            `hikari.WebResource` such as
            `hikari.URL`,
            `hikari.Attachment`,
            `hikari.Emoji`,
            `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
            This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
            resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
            scalability.
        * If a `hikari.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
            that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
            with a randomized file name if not provided.
        * If a `hikari.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
            `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
            on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
            as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
            using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
            type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
            the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
            behaviour).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.Message
            The message that has been edited.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
        TypeError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are specified.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; if `reply` is not found or not in the
            same channel as `channel`; too many components.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel or the
            person you are trying to message has the DM's disabled.
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the channel is not found.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.

            This parameter does nothing in the message command flow, as the result
            will always be available, but is present to keep the signature
            compatible with `Context.respond`.
        delete_after : typing.Union[datetime.timedelta, float, int, None]
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be delete.

            .. note::
                As of writing, this does not support ephemeral slash command responses.
        tts : hikari.UndefinedOr[bool]

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or `hikari.PartialUser`
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.

        Notes
        -----
        Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
        convenience.
        * If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
            resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
            sending the message. Subclasses of
            `hikari.WebResource` such as
            `hikari.URL`,
            `hikari.Attachment`,
            `hikari.Emoji`,
            `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
            This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
            resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
            scalability.
        * If a `hikari.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
            that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
            with a randomized file name if not provided.
        * If a `hikari.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
            `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
            on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
            as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
            using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
            type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
            the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
            behaviour).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.Message
            The message that has been created.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.

            If the interaction will have expired before `delete_after` is reached.
        TypeError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are specified.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; if `reply` is not found or not in the
            same channel as `channel`; too many components.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel or the
            person you are trying to message has the DM's disabled.
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the channel is not found.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        delete_after : typing.Union[datetime.timedelta, float, int, None]

        attachments : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Resourceish]]
            If provided, the message attachments. These can be resources, or
            strings consisting of paths on your computer or URLs.
        component : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Embed]]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.

            This includes if the REST interaction server has already responded
            to the request and deferrals.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        delete_after : typing.Union[datetime.timedelta, float, int, None]
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be delete.

            .. note::
                As of writing, this does not support ephemeral slash command responses.
        content : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Any]
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `str`.

            If this is a `hikari.Embed` and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg
            is provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows
            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.
        component : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed : hikari.UndefinedOr[hikari.Embed]
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds : hikari.UndefinedOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Embed]]
            If provided, the message embeds.
        flags : typing.Union[int, hikari.MessageFlag, hikari.UndefinedType]
            If provided, the message flags this response should have.

            As of writing the only message flag which can be set here is
            `hikari.MessageFlag.EPHEMERAL`.
        tts : hikari.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        mentions_everyone : hikari.UndefinedOr[bool]
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.PartialUser` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialRole], bool]]
            If provided, and `True`, all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and `False`, all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.

            If the interaction will have expired before `delete_after` is reached.
        TypeError
            If both `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

            If an `__all__` is present in the target module then it will be

        Examples
        --------
        For this to work the target module has to have at least one loader present.

        ```py
        @tanjun.as_loader

        Parameters
        ----------
        *modules : typing.Union[str, pathlib.Path]
            Path(s) of the modules to load from.

            When `str` this will be treated as a normal import path which is
            absolute (`"foo.bar.baz"`). It's worth noting that absolute module
            paths may be imported from the current location if the top level
            module is a valid module file or module directory in the current
            working directory.

            When `pathlib.Path` the module will be imported directly from
            the given path. In this mode any relative imports in the target
            module will fail to resolve.
