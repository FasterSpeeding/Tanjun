            [None][] will remove all components.
        components
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing [None][] or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed
            An embed to replace the initial response with.
        embeds
            A sequence of embeds to replace the initial response with.
        replace_attachments
            Whether to replace the attachments of the response or not.
        mentions_everyone
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all mentions will be parsed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        content
            The content to edit the last response with.

            If provided, the message contents. If
            [hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED][], then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a

            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a [hikari.files.Resource][], then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.
        delete_after
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be deleted.

            Slash command responses can only be deleted within 15 minutes of
            the command being received.
        attachment

        component
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            [None][] will remove all components.
        components
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing [None][] or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed
            An embed to replace the last response with.
        embeds
            A sequence of embeds to replace the last response with.
        replace_attachments
            Whether to replace the attachments of the response or not.
        mentions_everyone
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and [False][], no mentions will be parsed.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            [hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake][], or [hikari.users.PartialUser][]
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and [False][], no mentions will be parsed.

            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific roles.

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.Message
            The message that has been edited.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.

            If `delete_after` would be more than 15 minutes after the slash
            command was called.

            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are passed or both `component`
            and `components` are passed or both `embed` and `embeds` are passed.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; too many components.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel or the
            person you are trying to message has the DM's disabled.
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the channel is not found.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError

        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; if `reply` is not found or not in the
            same channel as `channel`; too many components.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).

            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel or the

            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        attachment
            If provided, the message attachment. This can be a resource,
            or string of a path on your computer or a URL.
        attachments
            If provided, the message attachments. These can be resources, or
            strings consisting of paths on your computer or URLs.
        component
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds
            If provided, the message embeds.
        flags
            If provided, the message flags this response should have.

            As of writing the only message flag which can be set here is
            [hikari.messages.MessageFlag.EPHEMERAL][].
        tts
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        mentions_everyone
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and [False][], all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            [hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake][], or [hikari.users.PartialUser][]
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and [False][], all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            [hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake], or [hikari.guilds.PartialRole][]
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific roles.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.

            If the interaction will have expired before `delete_after` is reached.

            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are passed or both `component`
            and `components` are passed or both `embed` and `embeds` are passed.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.
