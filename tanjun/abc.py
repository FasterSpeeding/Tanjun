        ----------
        content : typing.Any | hikari.UNDEFINED
            The content to edit the initial response with.

            If provided, the message contents. If

        ----------------
        delete_after : datetime.timedelta | float | int | None
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be deleted.

            .. note::
                Slash command responses can only be deleted within 14 minutes of the
                command being received.

            .. note::
                Since (as of writing) ephemeral responses cannot be deleted by the bot,
                this is ignored for ephemeral slash command responses.
        attachment : hikari.Resourceish | hikari.UNDEFINED
            A singular attachment to edit the initial response with.
        attachments : collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Resourceish] | hikari.UNDEFINED
            A sequence of attachments to edit the initial response with.
        component : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.
        embed : hikari.Embed | hikari.UNDEFINED
            An embed to replace the initial response with.
        embeds : collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Embed] | hikari.UNDEFINED
            A sequence of embeds to replace the initial response with.
        replace_attachments : bool
            Whether to replace the attachments of the response or not. Default to `False`.
        mentions_everyone : bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or `hikari.PartialUser`
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialRole] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        Notes
        -----
        Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
        convenience.
        * If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
            resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
            sending the message. Subclasses of
            `hikari.WebResource` such as
            `hikari.URL`,
            `hikari.Attachment`,
            `hikari.Emoji`,
            `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
            This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
            resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
            scalability.
        * If a `hikari.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
            that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
            with a randomized file name if not provided.
        * If a `hikari.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
            `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
            on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
            as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
            using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
            type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
            the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
            behaviour).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.Message
            The message that has been edited.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.
            If `delete_after` would be more than 14 minutes after the slash
            command was called.

            A sequence of attachments to edit the last response with.
        component : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]
            If provided, builder object of the component to set for this message.
            This component will replace any previously set components and passing
            `None` will remove all components.
        components : hikari.UndefinedNoneOr[collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder]]
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects set for
            this message. These components will replace any previously set
            components and passing `None` or an empty sequence will
            remove all components.

            A sequence of embeds to replace the last response with.
        replace_attachments : bool
            Whether to replace the attachments of the response or not. Default to `False`.
        mentions_everyone : bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or `hikari.PartialUser`
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialRole] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of

        Notes
        -----
        Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
        convenience.
        * If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
            resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
            sending the message. Subclasses of
            `hikari.WebResource` such as
            `hikari.URL`,
            `hikari.Attachment`,
            `hikari.Emoji`,
            `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
            This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
            resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
            scalability.
        * If a `hikari.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
            that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
            with a randomized file name if not provided.
        * If a `hikari.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
            `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
            on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
            as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
            using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
            type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
            the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
            behaviour).

        """Respond to this context.

        Parameters
        ----------
        content : typing.Any | hikari.UNDEFINED
            The content to respond with.

            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `str`.

            If this is a `hikari.Embed` and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg
            is provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows
            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a `hikari.Resource`, then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        ensure_result : bool
            Ensure this method call will return a message object.

            This does nothing for message command contexts as the result w ill
            always be immedieatly available.
        delete_after : datetime.timedelta | float | int | None
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be deleted.
        tts : bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            Whether to respond with tts/text to speech or no.
        reply : bool | hikari.Snowflakeish | hikari.PartialMessage | hikari.UNDEFINED
            Whether to reply instead of sending the content to the context.

            Defaults to `hikari.UNDEFINED`.
            Passing `True` here indicates a reply to `MessageContext.message`.
        nonce : str | hikari.UNDEFINED
            The nonce that validates that the message was sent.
        attachment : hikari.Resourceish | hikari.UNDEFINED
            A singular attachment to respond with.
        attachments : collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Resourceish] | hikari.UNDEFINED
            A sequence of attachments to respond with.
        component : hikari.api.ComponentBuilder | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components : collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.api.ComponentBuilder] | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed : hikari.Embed | hikari.UNDEFINED
            An embed to respond with.
        embeds : collections.abc.Sequence[hikari.Embed] | hikari.UNDEFINED
            A sequence of embeds to respond with.
        mentions_everyone : bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or `hikari.PartialUser`
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialRole] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all mentions will be parsed.
            If provided, and `False`, no mentions will be parsed.
            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            `hikari.Snowflake`, or
            `hikari.PartialRole` derivatives to enforce mentioning
            specific roles.

        Notes
        -----
        Attachments can be passed as many different things, to aid in
        convenience.
        * If a `pathlib.PurePath` or `str` to a valid URL, the
            resource at the given URL will be streamed to Discord when
            sending the message. Subclasses of
            `hikari.WebResource` such as
            `hikari.URL`,
            `hikari.Attachment`,
            `hikari.Emoji`,
            `EmbedResource`, etc will also be uploaded this way.
            This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the
            resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in
            scalability.
        * If a `hikari.Bytes` is passed, or a `str`
            that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded
            with a randomized file name if not provided.
        * If a `hikari.File`, `pathlib.PurePath` or
            `str` that is an absolute or relative path to a file
            on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded
            as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed
            using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the
            type of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is being used for
            the application (default is a thread pool which supports this
            behaviour).

        Returns
        -------
        hikari.Message
            The message that has been created.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.

            If the interaction will have expired before `delete_after` is reached.
        TypeError
            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are specified.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no attachments or embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; too many attachments; attachments that are too large;
            invalid image URLs in embeds; if `reply` is not found or not in the
            same channel as `channel`; too many components.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.ForbiddenError
            If you are missing the `SEND_MESSAGES` in the channel or the
            person you are trying to message has the DM's disabled.
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the channel is not found.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting
            rate-limits automatically. This includes most bucket-specific
            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.

        content : typing.Any | hikari.UNDEFINED

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        delete_after : datetime.timedelta | float | int | None
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be deleted.

            .. note::
                Slash command responses can only be deleted within 14 minutes of the

                Since (as of writing) ephemeral responses cannot be deleted by the bot,
                this is ignored for ephemeral slash command responses.
        ephemeral : bool
            Whether the deferred response should be ephemeral.

            Passing `True` here is a shorthand for including `1 << 64` in the
            passed flags.

        ephemeral : bool
            Whether the deferred response should be ephemeral.

            Passing `True` here is a shorthand for including `1 << 64` in the
            passed flags.
        content : typing.Any | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, the message contents. If
            `hikari.UNDEFINED`, then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a

            If this is a `hikari.Embed` and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg

        mentions_everyone : bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions : hikari.SnowflakeishSequence[hikari.PartialUser] | bool | hikari.UNDEFINED
            If provided, and `True`, all user mentions will be detected.

            if appearing in the message body.

            If the interaction will have expired before `delete_after` is reached.
        TypeError
            If both `embed` and `embeds` are specified.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.RateLimitedError
            Usually, Hikari will handle and retry on hitting

            rate-limits and global rate-limits. In some rare edge cases,
            however, Discord implements other undocumented rules for
            rate-limiting, such as limits per attribute. These cannot be
            detected or handled normally by Hikari due to their undocumented
            nature, and will trigger this exception if they occur.
        hikari.InternalServerError
