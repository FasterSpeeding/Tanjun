# While this example uses AnyHooks (which are hooks that can be used between
# both the slash command and message command flows in a similar fashion to
# checks which take `tanjun.abc.Context`), there's also `tanjun.SlashChecks`
# and `tanjun.MessageChecks` which are specialised for the relevant flows.

    """General error handler.

    This will be called on all errors raised during execution except errors
    derived from and including the following errors: `tanjun.CommandError`,
    `tanjun.HaltExecution` and `tanjun.ParserError`.

    To handle parser errors see `tanjun.Hooks.with_on_parser_error`.

    This must have take following positional arguments and return type:

    Parameters
    ----------
    ctx : tanjun.abc.Context
        The command context this error was raised for.
    exc : Exception
        The error which was raised.

    Returns
    -------
    typing.Optional[bool]
        The return type indicates whether this hook wants the error to be
        suppressed where `True` indicates that it should be suppressed,
        `False` indicates that it should be re-raised and `None` indicates
        no decision.

        This value will be considered along with the results of any other hooks
        being called during execution by a majority rule system and if all
        hooks return `None` then the error will be raised.

    It should be noted that `tanjun.Client` comes with a default parser error
    handler and calling `Client.set_hooks` will remove said handler.

    This must have the following positional arguments and return type:

    Parameters
    ----------
    ctx : tanjun.abc.Context
        The command context this error was raised for.
    exc : Exception
        The parser error which was raised.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Unlike general error handlers, parser errors are always suppressed if
        they're handled by a hook.
