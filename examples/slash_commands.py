"""Example basic usage of Tanjun's slash command system."""

# As a note, a slash command context should always be responded to as leaving
# it without a response will leave the command call either marked as loading
# for 15 minutes (if it's been deferred) or marked as failed after
# 3 seconds (by default slash commands are automatically deferred before the
# 3 second expire mark but this doesn't negate the need to give an actual
# response).
#
# For most of these examples `tanjun.abc.SlashContext.respond` is used for
# responding to interactions, this abstracts away the interactions response
# flow by tracking state on the Context object in-order to decide how to
# respond. While the lower level approache may also be used for responding it
# is generally recommended that you use the relevant lower level methods on
# `tanjun.abc.SlashContext` to allow state to still be tracked and ensure
# better compatibility.

# Here we declare a command as defaulting to ephemeral, this means that all
# calls made to SlashContext's message creating methods (e.g. respond,
# create_initial_respones and create_followup) will be ephemeral (only visible
# to the user who called the command) unless `flags` is specified. This includes
# calls made by command checks and by the CommandError handler.

    # context once and any further calls will result in an error being raised.

    # As another note, an initial response for a slash context must be created
    # within 3 seconds of the interaction being received otherwise it will
    # either be automatically deferred or expire (if automatic deferral is
    # disabled). In the case that an interaction is deferred then
