# Tanjun

A flexible command framework designed to extend Hikari.

# Instillation

You can install Tanjun from PyPI using the following command in any python 3.9 or above environment.

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari.git git+https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun.git
```

> **WARNING**: Since Tanjun@master targets Hikari@master, if you don't also
explicitly include Hikari in the install call then it will fail.

> **NOTE**: Pip installing straight from Tanjun@master is a temporary approach
which should be avoided once Hikari starts making regular releases again.
